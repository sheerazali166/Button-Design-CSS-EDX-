        <p>That is why this property "font-family" allows a list of fonts in the order of your preference. This comma-separated list orders your font preference from left to right. In our above example, our first choice is Helvetica, if the browser doesn't support that it will move to the next on the list, Verdana, and if it still doesn't support that it will just pick any sans-serif font it does support. You should always end your font family with fonts that are likely to be supported by the browser, this way I am guaranteed to have control over the font-family.</p>
